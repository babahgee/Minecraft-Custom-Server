# Custom Minecraft Server

Version 0.1.0

- - -

Custom Minecraft Server, or Minecraft: Custom Server, is a dedicated Minecraft server with a clean looking user interface. 
Minecraft players are allowed to create and customise their entire dedicated server and host it for their friends or family using Ngrok.

It's a free-to-use application **and** it is open-source, which means you can change the code whenever you want.

## Visuals.

Here are some images of how the application looks like. It has a clean design and is easy to read.

As you can see, it looks really nice and simple to use. Some pages may not be available, but will be in the future.
