# Server Files

- - -

In order to let the server operate properly, you'll need the server execution files. I will list 
all the links down below.

The files are packaged in a .zip file and has been uploaded to MegaNZ. Download the files for the Minecraft
version you'd like to play on and extract it somewhere where you want it to be.

Then, copy the directory of the server files and place it in the input field to enter the 'Server path'.

## Troubleshooting

Frequently asked questions about the server files.

#### What to do if some files are missing?

Once you press on the 'Create' button in the setup page **after** you setup all the settings you need, 
it will check for each specific file and directory, to see if they exist or not.

If they don't exist, you will get an error and you need to re-download the server files.

#### Can I transfer my own Minecraft world?

Yes you can.


**For version 0.1.0 users:**

1. Copy your world files and head over to your server files in the directory where they are directed.
2. Head over to Server > Lobby and put the world files there.
   
It should work.


**For version 0.2.0 users:**

You can transfer server files in the tab 'Server files' in-app. 

Select a folder you want to transfer and it does it all automatically. You can also transfer files
from Aternos or other online Minecraft-server services.
